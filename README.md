# Sneatch E-Commerce Full Frontend

## A fully non functional example

The project is older than the date I published it. It was a assignment from school to make a e-commerce website using only HTML and CSS. So the website doesn't have any usable function, but show my design skill to make a user friendly and beautiful website.
These are the none usable function of the website:

* Long in
* Sign up
* A precise filter
* chackout
* Catalog
* A loop video home page
* A contact page
